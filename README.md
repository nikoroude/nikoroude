- 👋 Hi, I’m @nikoroude and I am 30 years old, from Concepcion del Uruguay, province of Entre Ríos, Argentina.
  <p>For a few years, starting in 2010, I studied Information Systems Engineering, a career that I did not finish for personal and work reasons.</p>
  <p>Then, in 2019, I began to study Administration Technician again, in which I am currently in the last year.</p>
  <p>At the same time, in 2022, looking for a new challenge, I decided to listen to my curiosity and start a career as a Full Stack Developer at CoderHouse.</p>
